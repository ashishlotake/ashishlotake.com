I am a data scientist, machine learning practitioner, and artificial intelligence practitioner. For better or worse, I believe ML and AI will become an important part of our daily lives and will be available to everyone, and I intend to steer this boat. In order to collaborate and deliver production-ready models, I am learning practical skills in tools such as Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, and various ML tools.
